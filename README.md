This is a code repository for the Problem Statement 2 in the Tech-A-Thon 3.0 organised in GBU, Gautam Buddh Nagar <br/><br/>

## Problem Statement 2

<br/>Create a meeting scheduler where any user can schedule a meeting with another using an unique link according to their time slots available. <br/>Public User: <br/> ● User can schedule a meeting from admin user link on available time slots. <br/>● User should input his full name, email and notes for the scheduled meeting. <br/>Admin User: <br/>● Admin user can create a link for meeting with desired time slots. <br/>● Display the list of all the meetings created under the link <br/><br/> # What we did? <br/> 1. We created a user interface using React and Ant Design.<br/> 2. We decided the user flow.<br/> 3. We broke the problem and designed the database model.<br/> 4. In the database model we designed schema for both doctor and user.<br/> 5. The user can check availability of the doctors and can book appointment.<br/> 6. Any normal user can apply to be doctor which can be approved or blocked by the admin.<br/> 7. We used nodejs and express for the Rest API.<br/> 8. We used mongodb as our databse.<br/> 9. We deployed frontend on Netlify.<br/> 10. We deployed backend on Heroku. <br/><br/> # What we learnt during Tech-A-Thon 3.0?<br/> 1. We learnt the difficulties faced by the developers in the process of development.<br/> 2. Knew the way the team works to build in the limited time period.<br/> 3. We happen to face real world problems with the time constraint and happened to solve them with greater motivation.<br/> 4. Tech-A-Thon 3.0 helped us connect to some of the great developers that also joint the event on 24 September 2022. <br/>5. Sir motivated us to solve real world problems in addition to learning CP and DSA.
